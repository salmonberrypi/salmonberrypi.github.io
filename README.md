# Background

This project was initially started during the pandemic to focus on something fun, learn, and detract from the madness of the time.  And it includes several experiments.  The more I experimented, the more the broken PCIe bus on the Raspberry Pi CM4 became a detraction. Squirrel!

Fast forward to 2024, picking this project up again but refocusing this work after some reflection.
